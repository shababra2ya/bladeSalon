## Setup & Development

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```

   ```
   This starts both the Express backend and Vite frontend on port 5000.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Business Rules

- **Operating Hours**: 09:00 - 19:00 (appointments must fit within these hours)

  - Shave: 30 minutes  
  - Combo: 60 minutes
- **Required Fields**: Email and phone number for all bookings
- **Validation**: Email format and phone number validation on server

## Environment Variables

No environment variables required for basic functionality. All data is stored in memory.

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:
- Replace MemStorage with persistent database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Add authentication for admin routes
- Implement email/SMS confirmations
- Add calendar integration (.ics downloads)
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Add rate limiting and security middleware
